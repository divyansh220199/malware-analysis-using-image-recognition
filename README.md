# Aim 
aims at exploring a new technique to represent malware files as images and then using existing deep learning techniques or machine learning
algorithms, for classifying images, to train a classifier for classifying new malware files into their respective classes, making the 
process independent of any tool and less time consuming.

soon new files will be uploaded.
